        I am a Junior Software Developer, who enjoys designing and building sites and apps from scratch, to solve problems.  I have an array of tools in my repertoire, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python with Django and Vuejs, that I use to create dynamic and engaging sites.  At the moment I am working through <strong>Free Code Camp</strong>, and recently completed the <strong>Android developer scholarship</strong> designed by <strong>Google</Strong>.  I am currently looking for my second role in the tech industry and I am open to offers in the London area.  <p id="skills"><h4>

           I created this application to showcase my understanding of how to use the users location to tailor content that is specific to their whereabouts. The backgrounds are loaded dynamically to match the various weather.

           This is my Random Quote Generator.  I created it in order to learn how I can retrieve information from an API that would otherwise be hardcoded into the application.  The text colour and background change upon a new quote being loaded, this is to display my knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript.

           This twitter bot was the first application I made which solved a problem I was facing...I found that whilst reading, I would find words that I didn't know, look them up and then forget them.  So I decided to create a modern day equivalent of those "word-a-day calendars".  The modern aspect of it being that it will tweet the user once a day (or text them).
